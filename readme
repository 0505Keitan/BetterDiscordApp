1. Copy the app middleware to discord dir. eg: %localappdata%/discord/app-0.0.1/resources
2. Edit the config inside the middleware dir so that basepath points to where core dir is and datapath points to where you want your plugins etc to be.

Example:

```
{
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "debug": true,

  "basePath": "G:/BetterDiscord",
  "dataPath": "G:/BdData"
}
```
